Hawking was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1982 and a Companion of Honour in 1989. These objects, called mini black holes, are unique in that their immense mass and gravity require that they be ruled by the laws of relativity, while their minute size requires that the laws of quantum mechanics apply to them also. In 1971 he suggested the formation, following the big bang, of numerous objects containing as much as one billion tons of mass but occupying only the space of a proton.

With Sciama\\'s encouragement, he returned to his work.[73][74] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964.[75][76]\\nWhen Hawking began his doctoral studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and Steady State theories.[77] Inspired by Roger Penrose\\'s theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic.[78][79] In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller.[90] With James M. Bardeen and Brandon Carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics.[91] To Hawking\\'s irritation, Jacob Bekenstein, a graduate student of John Wheeler, went further—and ultimately correctly—to apply thermodynamic concepts literally.[92][93]\\nIn the early 1970s, Hawking\\'s work with Carter, Werner Israel, and David C. Robinson strongly supported Wheeler\\'s no-hair theorem, one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and rotation.[94][95] His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.[44][45] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats,[46] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception.[47] From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.[48][49]\\nAlthough known at school as \"Einstein\", Hawking was not initially successful academically.[50] With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by Tahta, decided to read mathematics at university.[51][52][53] Despite suggestions that he might leave the United Kingdom as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research,[210] Hawking worked as director of research at the Cambridge University Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.[211]\\nOn 28 June 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of his 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, Hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d\\'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party.[212]\\nOn 20 July 2015, Hawking helped launch Breakthrough Initiatives, an effort to search for extraterrestrial life.[213]'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mStephen Hawking was a British theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author.
